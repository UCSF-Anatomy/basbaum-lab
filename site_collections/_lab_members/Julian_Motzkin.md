I am a clinician-scientist and recently minted neurologist interested in central mechanisms underlying the aversiveness of chronic pain. I am currently completing a one year Clinical Pain Medicine fellowship at UCSF. In the lab, I use calcium imaging to interrogate projections between prefrontal structures and brainstem nuclei implicated in antinociception and escape.
